## Challenges Faced and Their Solutions

### 1. Circles and Line Alignment
**Problem:**  
Initially, the circles in the progress bar were misaligned with the connecting lines, causing inconsistencies in the visual flow.

**Solution:**  
- Adjusted the positioning of the lines using relative positioning (`top-1/2`) to ensure vertical alignment.
- Fine-tuned the placement of dashed and solid lines with `translate-y` to ensure symmetry.
- Applied conditional Tailwind classes to differentiate between completed, current, and upcoming steps.

### 2. File Upload Interaction
**Problem:**  
The upload boxes initially did not visually reflect the interaction.

**Solution:**  
- Added placeholder content to guide users (e.g., _"Write your statement here or upload a PDF"_).
- Integrated `useRef` and `onClick` handlers for triggering file uploads, ensuring a smooth upload experience.
- Alerted users with the file name upon upload to confirm successful selection.

### 3. Alignment and Spacing
**Problem:**  
Spacing inconsistencies between elements (e.g., between upload boxes, circles, and lines).

**Solution:**  
- Used Tailwind’s `gap`, `space-y`, and `space-x` utilities for consistent horizontal and vertical spacing.
- Expanded the width of specific boxes for better visibility while maintaining alignment.

## Assumptions Made

### 1. Tailwind CSS Framework
- Assumed the project would use **Tailwind CSS** for styling to accelerate development and maintain consistency.
- Leveraged its prebuilt utilities such as `grid`, `flex`, `rounded`, and `gap` for layout and design.

### 2. Icons Library
- Used **react-icons** for icons to avoid the overhead of designing custom SVGs.

### 3. File Upload Functionality
- Assumed basic file upload functionality with no server-side integration.
- Implemented only client-side handlers to alert users upon file selection.

### 4. Desktop-First Design
- Designed primarily for desktop users but ensured a responsive layout for mobile and tablet devices using Tailwind’s responsive breakpoints (e.g., `md:grid-cols-3`).
